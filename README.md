To run the downloaded executable, use any of the following following commands:

bun-b8a2ef88f12626706f03d051e4026309f0d61ed0-pr8456
bun-8456
bun-latest
```

It doesn't just run bun directly command because in development we often will want to attach a debugger.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.30. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
